# QRScan
iOS QR Scanner

This was a simple QR Scanner app that I built to just learn and play around with the technology. 
Its functionality is very limited in that it only brings back the text that is stored in the QR code.
However, it is a good start. Hopefully, as I learn more about QR codes and QR generator, I will be
able to improve this project.
